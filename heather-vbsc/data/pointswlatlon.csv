We partner with the very best farmers in Central Texas that utilize sustainable agriculture and ranching methods to produce the highest quality, most flavorful product found on the market. Because local products do not have to travel far to reach the consumer, the produce can be picked when it is ripest. When a fruit or vegetable is given the time to completely ripen, it fully develops and retains its vitamins and minerals, giving it a more vibrant flavor and maximizing the nutritional content. Our produce is generally harvested within 36 hours of delivery. They have a longer time to ripen “on the vine” and are ready to eat when delivered. They are not picked and processed and then spend a week or more traveling. Other non-local farms pick their produce when it’s still green or unripe. A common practice is to “gas” green tomatoes so they turn red. The result is a red tomato with the taste and texture of a green tomato. Sustainability practices ensure that the land used to raise farm products is healthy and available for years to come. Farm to Table has partnered with farmers and ranchers that have various means to use less non-renewable resources, make less impact on the environment, and grow a healthy and profitable end product.
